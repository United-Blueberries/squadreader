"""Machine-specific runtime configuration.

The reader is driven by CLI flags first; anything not passed falls back to this
config, and anything not in the config falls back to a built-in default. So a
stranger on a standard box needs NO config at all — the Squad server is found by
its process name and output dirs default next to the repo. Only non-standard
setups (an install path outside ``/home/<user>/serverfiles``, a custom server
id) need a ``sqreader.config.json`` — copy ``sqreader.config.example.json``.

Resolution order for every key:  CLI flag  >  env var  >  sqreader.config.json  >
DEFAULTS. The config file is located via ``$SQREADER_CONFIG``, else
``./sqreader.config.json``. Every key can also be set via ``SQREADER_<KEY>`` (e.g.
``SQREADER_SQUAD_PORT``) — handy for containers, where editing a mounted config
file per-deployment is more friction than an env var.
